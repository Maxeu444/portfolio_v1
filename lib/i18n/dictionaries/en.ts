    description: `
My name is Max Hochart, and for the past two years I’ve been designing and developing web applications that meet real needs — internal tools, web platforms, high-performance sites, and robust APIs.

Trained in both backend development (Java Spring Boot, PHP) and modern frontend technologies (Next.js, Nuxt.js), with experience deploying on AWS, I have worked on a wide variety of projects through alternance and scholarly work. This diversity taught me how to understand a requirement, structure it, and turn it into a reliable and scalable solution.

What motivates me is learning, understanding, and building useful products. Today, I want to bring my fullstack experience to a team that enjoys creating solid, well-designed projects — and continue growing alongside them.
